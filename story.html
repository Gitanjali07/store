	<p>In beauty terms, it all starts with Chanel No5. It is the best-selling fragrance in the world. The world! That's a lot of people all going around smelling the same. It started life back in 1921 when Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel was already reigning over the Paris fashion world. Created with Russian perfumer to the Tsars, Ernest Beaux, the name for Chanel's first fragrance is said to come from her superstitious belief in the virtues of the number five. Apparently she picked the fifth sample presented to her by Beaux and the simple name stuck. It was the first time that a fashion house had created a perfume and it soon became a huge hit. At the same time, Chanel started to expand and go global launching a cosmetics line (in 1924) and a range of skincare products (in 1929).</p>

<div class="about" id="s4">
	<p>In the 50s, Chanel No5 really was the perfume to be, erm, smelt in. In a 1954 interview, Marilyn Monroe famously answered the question "What do you wear to bed?" with the line "Just a few drops of No5". The popularity of the perfume grew and grew but this wasn't necessarily a great thing. In the 70s it was decided that No5 had lost its air of exclusivity so it was reinvented and made less widely available. Huge advertising campaigns were adopted using big name directors and big name stars - a Chanel tradition that lives on to this day.</p>

<div class="about" id="s6">
	<p>• Gabrielle Bonheur "Coco" Chanel was born in 1883 and died in 1971 • <br> She created a new look for women in the 20th century, creating clothes that were primarily comfortable. A Chanel suit of 1923 or handbag is still seen as a landmark purchase for women of increasingly younger ages • The Chanel No.5 scent is the best selling in the world • The interlocking Cs of Coco Chanel remain one of the ultimate brand insignia • Since 1983, Chanel has been designed by Karl Lagerfeld • The building where her apartment is in Paris was bought by Chanel in 1920, and still houses the ground-floor shop, the haute couture workrooms in the attic (where 100 seamstresses still work entirely by hand), and what is now Karl Lagerfeld's study
	Coco Chanel's bobbed hair, bright red lips and outspoken manner also broke the mould. This smoking, outspoken woman never married - although she had relations with the English industrialist Arthur "Boy" Capel - who lent her the money to buy Rue Cambon - Igor Stravinsky and the second Duke of Westminster Hugh "Bendor" Grosvenor, the richest man in Europe. Keira Knightley followed Kate Moss as the new face of Coco Mademoiselle in 2007. The brand could not be more alive with watches, beauty, fragrance, womenswear and new stores. In 2009 a biopic film based on her life titled 'Coco before Chanel' was released. Audrey Tatou was given the lead-role and follows as she goes from orphan to Haute Couture designer.</p>
